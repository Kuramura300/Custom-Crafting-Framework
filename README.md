# Custom Crafting Framework
 
The Custom Crafting Framework is a package for the Unity game engine to assist game developers in creating a custom crafting system in their game. It will allow for objects to have any properties the developer wants which behaviour can be made from, and which can affect an object differently when combined.

Within the package, an example implementation is included where you have a stick with variable length and a rock with variable sharpness. Combining them will give you a weapon with different range and sharpness depending on those properties.

The framework is generic so that it is able to support a wide range of implementations, not limited to item crafting (it could be used for spell crafting or creating robots from different parts for example).

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Kuramura300/Custom-Crafting-Framework/wiki) for more details on how the framework works and how it can be used.
